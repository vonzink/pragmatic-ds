-- V44 — Schedule D and Schedule F, authored from the committed 2025 blanks
-- (docs/reference-forms/f1040sd.pdf, f1040sf.pdf).
--
-- Both forms currently classify UNKNOWN at 0.20 and extract nothing, and the
-- reason is upstream of any schema: there is no document_type for either, so
-- there is nothing for a page to classify AS and extraction never runs. This
-- migration supplies the type, the pack and the schema in that order.
--
-- Two facts shaped the anchor sets, and both were checked against ten other
-- blank forms before a line of this file was written (the V10 rule, applied
-- before a real document exposes it rather than after):
--
-- 1. The 1040 does NOT print "Schedule D (Form 1040)". It prints "Attach
--    Schedule D if required", so the PARENTHESIZED-FORM regex is safe where a
--    bare "Schedule D" would fire on the first page of every return ever filed.
--    Same fact V31 records for the K-1 mastheads, third use.
-- 2. Schedule F overlaps Schedule C on 648 phrases — both are "Profit or Loss
--    From …" forms sharing an expense vocabulary down to "Name of proprietor".
--    That is why NO expense-line wording is anchored above weight 2 here, and
--    why the only weight-3 anchor on each form is its own masthead subtitle.
--    CrossConfusionIT is the gate; the overlap is the reason it matters.
--
-- Degraded recall with the form regex lost to OCR: Schedule D 9, Schedule F 8,
-- both still clear of the 6.0 bar that 0.60 against targetScore 10 imposes.

-- ── §2 rule packs ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Weight = exclusivity, never salience. Every anchor below was verified present
-- on its own blank form and absent from f1040, f1040sb, f1040sc, f1040se,
-- f1040sj, f1065sk1, f1120ssk, f1041sk1, fw2 and f8825 — and no anchor of
-- weight 3 or more appears on any of them.
--
-- What is DELIBERATELY not anchored is the more interesting half. Schedule F
-- prints "Name of proprietor", "(Form 1040)" and "Attach to Form 1040" exactly
-- as Schedule C does; anchoring any of it would have bought recall this pack
-- does not need and handed SCHEDULE_C a page it must never win. The expense
-- vocabulary ("Supplies", "Utilities", "Taxes") is shared with half the
-- self-employment forms in the corpus and carries weight 0 here by omission.
--
-- "Accrual method" is worth flagging: it reads like a checkbox caption but the
-- phrase the form actually prints beside the boxes is "Accounting method: Cash
-- Accrual". The anchored phrase lives in the Part I HEADING's parenthetical —
-- "(Accrual method. Complete Parts II and III…)" — which is also the one place
-- it survives onto page 2, so the anchor keeps its meaning on a continuation.

-- ── §3 extraction schemas ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Both schemas start from the drafts tools/schema_draft.py produced against
-- filled corpus documents (26 fields at 93% for D, 49 at 91% for F, its two
-- best results) and both were reviewed field by field rather than installed.
-- Four kinds of change came out of that review, and each is a judgement a
-- reader is entitled to disagree with:
--
--  * The two fields the generator PARKED on Schedule D — the return-name header
--    and the long-term loss carryover — are authored here by hand as
--    taxpayerName and longTermCapitalLossCarryover. A parked field is a gap in
--    the draft, not a field the form does not have.
--  * Machine-minted names are gone. "totalsForAllTransactionsReportedOn5" is
--    the third column of the second 8949 totals row and nothing else; it is
--    longTermBoxEGainOrLoss here, read by LINE_RIGHT occurrence off the ONE
--    caption the row actually prints, which is what the numbered suffixes were
--    standing in for.
--  * All SIX 8949 totals rows are modelled (Boxes A-C short-term, D-F
--    long-term), three columns each — proceeds, cost basis, gain — separated
--    only by LINE_RIGHT occurrence 0/1/2 off their own row's caption.
--
-- Those eighteen fields are flat, and NOT a repeating group, which is the one
-- decision here most likely to be questioned. The rows do repeat, so a group
-- looks right until you ask what the key would be. A LABELED row group joins on
-- a printed letter found as the LEFTMOST span of the line, and enforces a shared
-- gutter across the rows; Schedule D prints no gutter letter at all — its box
-- letter sits INSIDE the caption ("with Box B checked"), where that rung cannot
-- reach it. A COUNTED group would key 01/02/03, and the row-key contract is
-- explicit that ordinals are for tables the form does NOT letter. Schedule D
-- letters these rows; the letter is simply in the prose. So a group here would
-- have to key on a coordinate the form does not print, or discard one it does,
-- and the caption already carries the letter uniquely — which makes six plain
-- captions the honest reading and a group key the clever wrong one.
--  * Schedule D's Part III (lines 16-22) is not modelled. Those lines are the
--    return's own arithmetic over line 7 and line 15 — both extracted here —
--    and the worksheet questions beside them are checkbox state, which has its
--    own rung. Modelling them as text is what made the draft flag five fields
--    "value_text_appears_more_than_once_on_page".
--  * Schedule F's three parked 32a-c slots collapse into one otherExpenses
--    field bound to line 32f, the total the form itself adds them to. The
--    slots are blank-ruled free text with no printed caption to anchor on, so
--    there is nothing for a label rung to name; the total is the number an
--    underwriter reads anyway.
--
-- Geometry: the identity blocks are BOX GRIDS (caption above, value below, the
-- V12 LABEL_BELOW defaults written out) and every money line is ANCHOR_LABEL
-- with LINE_RIGHT, which is the 1040 family's own layout. Schedule F's Part II
-- is TWO columns on a shared baseline, so each expense reads LINE_RIGHT off its
-- OWN caption and finds its own column's amount first — that is why every
-- caption below is the full printed wording and not a shortened key.
